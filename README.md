# Norwegian-Letter-Scramble-Solver
A simple script for solving letter puzzles where letters in a word are mixed and you are to figure out what word they can spell out.
The program has a generated wordlist and a function to generate a new wordlist for the program to use if so desired.
The program comes pre-packaged with a combination of all norwegian wordlists I was able to find, and has still not failed for a single word I have tried(but if you find one, please let me know;) )
